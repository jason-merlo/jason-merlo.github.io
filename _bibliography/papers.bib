	abstract={In this work, we experimentally demonstrate, for the first time, a fully wireless coherent distributed antenna array (CDA) performing distributed transmit and receive beamforming for a down-range sensing application at microwave frequencies without the need for external frequency and time references such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). We build on previous methods utilizing a continuous-wave (CW) two- tone frequency transfer system and a pulsed two-tone time synchronization system to align the distributed platforms in both time and frequency. Coherent transmit and receive beamforming was performed utilizing 100 MHz linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveforms for sensing. Two experiments were performed: one imaging a static scene and one imaging a moving pedestrian holding a corner reflector. The beamforming gain is quantified in the static measurements yielding a median beamforming gain of 2.12 dB and a maximum gain of 2.86 dB (96.5% coherent beamforming gain).},

  abstract={We present an approach to secure wireless communication based on dynamically changing the apparent phase center of a two-element antenna array using spatial amplitude dynamics. We implement phase center dynamics by modulating the relative amplitudes of the signals fed to two antenna elements. By moving the phase center symmetrically with respect to the geometric center of the array, the far-field amplitude pattern remains mostly constant while the phase pattern changes, imparting modulation onto the transmitted or received signals that is a function of angle. The resulting directional modulation effectively scrambles the information in the radiated waveform at angles outside of the information beam, where the modulation impacts are negligible. The result is a narrow region where information is recoverable, and since the radiated power does not change, the efficiency remains high. We present the design of a 2.5 GHz two-element array with asymmetric amplitude modulation and characterize the phase center location as a function of the amplitude ratio between the elements. We demonstrate secure wireless communication experimentally in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment, demonstrating the reduction in throughput due solely to the phase center dynamics. Finally, we analyze the information beamwidth and present a design procedure relating the amplitude ratio, SNR, element spacing, and QAM modulation format to the information beamwidth.},

Coherent operation in a distributed array requires accurate synchronization of the phase, frequency, and time on each node, and the precise localization of the transmitting nodes, which is challenging at microwave frequencies, especially for nodes that are spatially dynamic. The spatially sparse two-tone waveform and the linear frequency modulation (LFM) ranging waveform have been individually studied for two-way time synchronization and ranging extensively. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate the use of the combined two-tone LFM waveform to estimate the distances between the nodes and accurately calculate their locations. The accuracy of the combined waveform was measured experimentally and demonstrated localization accuracy of less than 1 cm. Based on these measurements, the system can theoretically support beamforming frequencies of up to 4.4 GHz.},

	abstract = {A new method of obtaining directional modulation by implementing antenna array dynamics is proposed. An asymmetric switching feed structure is implemented in a two-element array that supports a static antenna pattern in a desired direction while adding sufficient complex modulation at other angles to mitigate the transfer of information. The dynamic antenna array feeds are calibrated to be in-phase and have a signal feed amplitude ratio of approximately 6.15$\pm$0.1 dB through the design of an asymmetrical Wilkinson divider. The antenna system comprises of a two-state switching matrix using a double pole double throw (DPDT) RF switch. Secure communication capability is demonstrated in simulation and experiment by a 2.5 GHz two-element patch array. The communication system uses a 16-QAM single-carrier signal transmitting 48 kbits in a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) at a rate of 4 Mbits/s. The DPDT switch was synchronized to the transmitter symbol rate of 1 MHz. To isolate the effects of the phase dynamics, the communication system was operating at an SNR of 33 dB, thus transmitting high power to all directions. A low bit error ratio (BER) of <10^âˆ’3 is demonstrated at the desired transmission direction 13, with higher BER outside this region. A measurement of a static antenna yielded BER =0 in all directions; thus, the bit errors and narrow 13 information beamwidth were due exclusively to the antenna array dynamics. Performance metrics of this directional modulation technique are compared against previous literature for the reader. Further insights to spurious signals and mitigation are taken into consideration for the equipment and instrumentation of a narrowband signal to validate the technique as a viable ``black-box'' system implementation.},

Other works have shown that two-way time transfer using spectrally sparse two-tone ranging waveforms provides high accuracy timing synchronization. In addition to time correction, these waveforms may provide inter-node ranging with high accuracy. In this paper the accuracy of ranging via two-way time transfer for a two-node time synchronization system using a two-tone waveform is evaluated. Results are compared to ranging performance using a standard linear frequency modulated waveform (LFM).

There is also a repeater that retransmits an LFM from the secondary node that is used to estimate the separation of the node to correct for the phase rotation of the frequency signal due to propagation.

	abstract = {We introduce a new technique for secure wireless applications using a single dynamic antenna. The dynamic antenna supports a constantly and rapidly changing current distribution that generates a radiation pattern that is static in a desired direction and dynamic elsewhere. This imparts additional modulation on the signal and obscures information transmitted or received outside of the information beam, thus achieving directional modulation. Dynamic currents are supported by a single feed that is switched between separate ports on a single antenna, generating two different radiation patterns without changing the physical shape of the antenna. We introduce the theoretical concept by exploring an ideal complex dynamic radiation pattern that remains static in a narrow desired direction and is dynamic elsewhere. The impact on the transmission of information is analyzed, showing that the information beam narrows as the modulation order increases, and design constraints on the spatial width of the information beam as a function of modulation format are determined. We design and analyze a 2.3 GHz two-state dynamic dipole antenna and experimentally demonstrate secure wireless transmission. We demonstrate the ability to change the information beamwidth and steer the information beam experimentally in real time, and to maintain high throughput in the information beam while obscuring the information elsewhere. In contrast to multiport or array-based antennas, our approach introduces a novel rapidly switched single-element technique for secure wireless applications that can be used independently from the rest of the wireless system, essentially operating as a ``black box'' for an additional layer of security.},

Through the use of an efficient sub-pixel Fourier-based iterative correlation and refinement technique, sub-sections of the overall SAR images are aligned. Because only small sub-regions of the full SAR images are aligned at a time, this technique inherently compensates for accelerations experienced when sampling the synthetic aperture, by assuming a quasi-constant velocity over small sub-regions of the image. Because the image fusion is performed after image formation, this technique lends itself well to a distributed architecture where the image formation is performed on-vehicle and transferred to other vehicles or a centralized cloud processor where images from other vehicles can be aggregated. Finally, because the registration of sub-regions of the SAR images are performed, the registration alignment vector can be used as a odometry provider to improve vehicle odometry estimates; if a metrology grade SAR map is used as reference, a globally reference position estimate could be performed.},

	abstract = {Due to the rapid increase in 76 GHz automotive spectrum use in recent years, wireless interference is becoming a legitimate area of concern. However, the recent rise in interest of automated vehicles (AVs) has also spurred new growth and adoption of low frequency vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications in and around the 5.8 GHz unlicensed bands, opening the possibility for communications spectrum reuse in the form of joint radar-communications (JRC). In this work, we present a low frequency 5.9 GHz side-looking polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for automotive use, utilizing a ranging waveform in a common low frequency V2X communications band. A synthetic aperture technique is employed to address the angular resolution concerns commonly associated with radars at lower frequencies. Three side-looking fully polarimetric SAR images in various urban scenes are presented and discussed to highlight the unique opportunities for landmark inference afforded through measurement of co- and cross-polarized scattering.},

	abstract = {In this work, we derive the exact response of an interferometric correlation radar to an arbitrary scene containing N independent point scatterers. The response of an interferometric radar to multiple targets can be complicated by the nonlinear processing, which generates intermodulation responses in addition to the desired fundamental frequency responses. An accurate signal model is critical for predicting and mitigating these intermodulation products and allows for model-based parameter estimation methods to be used to estimate target angular velocity. We derive a general response to an arbitrary number of independent targets and validate both the exact model and a simpler approximate model via simulation and experimental measurement with a 38-GHz continuous-wave interferometric radar. The experiment contains two targets traveling perpendicular to the radar's line-of-sight on linear stages at speeds of 0.36 and 0.5 m/s. We use an error metric to describe the similarity between the measured or simulated time-frequency response and the time-frequency response of a signal generated using the frequency estimates of either the exact or approximate models and show that in regimes where the small-angle approximation holds, both models provide an accurate representation of the measured or simulated interferometric response, demonstrating the feasibility of these models.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a new approach to implementing directional modulation that leverages distributed array dynamics to change the antenna array pattern over time. With appreciable spacing between the elements, the spatial phase pattern varies rapidly, such that small physical motions result in large phase variations. We define an average radiation pattern that characterizes the space-time modulation of the array pattern and calculate a spatial information filter based on the additional modulation imparted on transmitted data. The concept is demonstrated experimentally using a two-element 1.5 GHz transmit array with relative motion between the elements. The array consists of two nodes, each with one dipole antennas transmitting BPSK data, and each with two log-periodic antennas used to estimate the relative separation of the nodes and correct the beamsteering phase of the transmitters. The node separation is varied dynamically over a range of $0.98\lambda$ -- $4.7\lambda$. We investigate the use of linearly- and sinusoidally-varying internode dynamics, and demonstrate a low bit-error-ratio of approximately 10-5 at the desired transmission direction, indicating high throughput, and a high error ratio of approximately 10-0.3 at angles outside of the mainbeam, indicating corrupted data, at a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB.},

	abstract = {In this work, a method for directly measuring target velocity in three dimensions using a dual axis correlation interferometric radar is presented. Recent advances have shown that the measurement of a target's angular velocity is possible by correlating the signals measured at spatially diverse aperture locations. By utilizing multiple orthogonal baselines and using conventional Doppler velocity methods to obtain radial velocity, a full three-dimensional velocity vector can be obtained using only three receive antennas and a single transmitter, without the need for tracking. A 41.8 GHz dual axis interferometric radar with a 7.26Î» antenna baseline is presented along with measurements of a target moving parallel to the plane of the radar array, and of a target moving with components of both radial and tangential velocity. These experiments achieved total velocity root-mean-square errors of 41.01 mm/s (10.5%) for a target moving along a plane parallel to the array, and 45.07 mm/s (13.5%) for a target moving with components of radial and tangential motion relative to the array; estimated trajectory angle RMSEs of 10.42$\,^{\circ}$ and 5.11$\,^{\circ}$ were achieved for each experiment respectively.},

We show that through the multiplication of the normalized instantaneous frequency measurements across different baselines, nonlinear intermodulation products resulting from dual-antenna interferometric angular velocity measurements can be mitigated, producing only the terms corresponding to the angular velocity of the targets in the scene. To validate this, simulations were performed demonstrating the close agreement between the proposed method and an ideal correlation (without intermodulation distortion). Near-field errors resulting from far-field approximations are analyzed. Finally, experimental results of a three-antenna, three-baseline 38 GHz interferometric radar are presented that demonstrate the recovery of the motion of two oscillating pendulums of differing angular frequencies.},
