We build on our previous work utilizing a high accuracy two-way time transfer (TWTT) technique for inter-node time synchronization and ranging and an analog continuous two-tone frequency transfer technique to perform syntonization by moving to a fully wireless architecture, without the need for external reference signals such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-derived pulse-per-second (PPS), including a distributed computing system architecture, and the use of fully wireless communication links between nodes. Finally, we perform a far-field beamforming experiment with beam steering to a receiver 17 m away at a carrier frequency of 1.05 GHz and demonstrate a beamforming coherent gain of 0.95 (9.32 dB) with a beamforming inter-element timing accuracy of below 60 ps.},

    abstract = {We demonstrate a wireless, decentralized time-alignment method for distributed antenna arrays and distributed wireless networks that achieves picosecond-level synchronization. Distributed antenna arrays consist of spatially separated antennas that coordinate their functionality at the wavelength level to achieve coherent operations such as distributed beamforming. Accurate time alignment (synchronization) of the local clocks on each node in the array is necessary to support accurate time-delay beamforming of modulated signals. In this work we combine a consensus averaging algorithm and a high-accuracy wireless two-way time transfer method to achieve decentralized time alignment, correcting for the time-varying bias of the clocks in a method that has no central node. Internode time transfer is based on a spectrally-sparse, two-tone signal achieving near-optimal time delay accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate the approach in a wireless four-node software-defined radio system, with various network connectivity graphs. We show that within 20 iterations all the nodes achieve convergence within a bias of less than 12 ps and a standard deviation of less than 3 ps. The performance is evaluated versus the bandwidth of the two-tone waveform, which impacts the synchronization error, and versus the signal-to-noise ratio.},

    abstract = {We present a decentralized approach to wireless picosecond-level synchronization of distributed antenna array elements that weights its connections based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the links between nodes. Time synchronization is a critical aspect of distributed phased array performance, and is a principal factor limiting the bandwidth of distributed beam-forming operations. We previously demonstrated decentralized synchronization with picosecond-level accuracy using a consensus averaging approach, where nodes iteratively share information among their neighbors to converge to the global average of the time offsets between nodes. Ensuring that all nodes in a distributed array reach consensus on a common time reference depends on the accuracy of the individual links, however, and low SNR links will generate poor time estimates, increasing the residual error of the converged state. Here, we propose a new weighting strategy based on evaluating the SNR in every iteration to allow for time information sharing only between the nodes with highest received SNR. We evaluate the approach experimentally through the implementation of a six-node system using software defined radios (SDRs), yielding in an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy relative to the case of a fully connected antenna array with a static topology.},

Traditionally, this has been done only in fixed systems, either on the ground or on a single platform. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to sample the spatial Fourier domain using a distributed microwave receiving array with wireless coordination of time and frequency. We implement a two-element receiving system based on software-defined radios that co-process received signals via cross-correlation, yielding samples of the spatial Fourier domain. We measure the complex interference pattern at 2.3 GHz and 3.3 GHz, representing baselines of 7λ and lOλ, respectively. The results demonstrate the feasibility of distributed Fourier domain sampling, a fundamental building block for distributed Fourier-domain imaging.},

	abbr = {IEEE TAP},
	abstract = {We present an approach to secure wireless communication based on dynamically changing the apparent phase center of a two-element antenna array using spatial amplitude dynamics. We implement phase center dynamics by modulating the relative amplitudes of the signals fed to two antenna elements. By moving the phase center symmetrically with respect to the geometric center of the array, the far-field amplitude pattern remains mostly constant while the phase pattern changes, imparting modulation onto the transmitted or received signals that is a function of angle. The resulting directional modulation effectively scrambles the information in the radiated waveform at angles outside of the information beam, where the modulation impacts are negligible. The result is a narrow region where information is recoverable, and since the radiated power does not change, the efficiency remains high. We present the design of a 2.5 GHz two-element array with asymmetric amplitude modulation and characterize the phase center location as a function of the amplitude ratio between the elements. We demonstrate secure wireless communication experimentally in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment, demonstrating the reduction in throughput due solely to the phase center dynamics. Finally, we analyze the information beamwidth and present a design procedure relating the amplitude ratio, SNR, element spacing, and QAM modulation format to the information beamwidth.},

Coherent operation in a distributed array requires accurate synchronization of the phase, frequency, and time on each node, and the precise localization of the transmitting nodes, which is challenging at microwave frequencies, especially for nodes that are spatially dynamic. The spatially sparse two-tone waveform and the linear frequency modulation (LFM) ranging waveform have been individually studied for two-way time synchronization and ranging extensively. In this paper we experimentally demonstrate the use of the combined two-tone LFM waveform to estimate the distances between the nodes and accurately calculate their locations. The accuracy of the combined waveform was measured experimentally and demonstrated localization accuracy of less than 1 cm. Based on these measurements, the system can theoretically support beamforming frequencies of up to 4.4 GHz.},

@article{randall2023awpl,
	abbr = {IEEE AWPL},
	abstract = {A new method of obtaining directional modulation by implementing antenna array dynamics is proposed. An asymmetric switching feed structure is implemented in a two-element array that supports a static antenna pattern in a desired direction while adding sufficient complex modulation at other angles to mitigate the transfer of information. The dynamic antenna array feeds are calibrated to be in-phase and have a signal feed amplitude ratio of approximately 6.15$\pm$0.1 dB through the design of an asymmetrical Wilkinson divider. The antenna system comprises of a two-state switching matrix using a double pole double throw (DPDT) RF switch. Secure communication capability is demonstrated in simulation and experiment by a 2.5 GHz two-element patch array. The communication system uses a 16-QAM single-carrier signal transmitting 48 kbits in a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) at a rate of 4 Mbits/s. The DPDT switch was synchronized to the transmitter symbol rate of 1 MHz. To isolate the effects of the phase dynamics, the communication system was operating at an SNR of 33 dB, thus transmitting high power to all directions. A low bit error ratio (BER) of <10^−3 is demonstrated at the desired transmission direction 13, with higher BER outside this region. A measurement of a static antenna yielded BER =0 in all directions; thus, the bit errors and narrow 13 information beamwidth were due exclusively to the antenna array dynamics. Performance metrics of this directional modulation technique are compared against previous literature for the reader. Further insights to spurious signals and mitigation are taken into consideration for the equipment and instrumentation of a narrowband signal to validate the technique as a viable ``black-box'' system implementation.},

The primary node acts as a distributed radar transmitter, sending a linear frequency-modulated (LFM) waveform downrange, toward the target. There is also a repeater that retransmits an LFM from the secondary node that is used to estimate the separation of the node to correct for the phase rotation of the frequency signal due to propagation. The secondary node also locks its oscillator to the primary node and captures the signal reflected from the scene.

	abstract = {We introduce a new technique for secure wireless applications using a single dynamic antenna. The dynamic antenna supports a constantly and rapidly changing current distribution that generates a radiation pattern that is static in a desired direction and dynamic elsewhere. This imparts additional modulation on the signal and obscures information transmitted or received outside of the information beam, thus achieving directional modulation. Dynamic currents are supported by a single feed that is switched between separate ports on a single antenna, generating two different radiation patterns without changing the physical shape of the antenna. We introduce the theoretical concept by exploring an ideal complex dynamic radiation pattern that remains static in a narrow desired direction and is dynamic elsewhere. The impact on the transmission of information is analyzed, showing that the information beam narrows as the modulation order increases, and design constraints on the spatial width of the information beam as a function of modulation format are determined. We design and analyze a 2.3 GHz two-state dynamic dipole antenna and experimentally demonstrate secure wireless transmission. We demonstrate the ability to change the information beamwidth and steer the information beam experimentally in real time, and to maintain high throughput in the information beam while obscuring the information elsewhere. In contrast to multiport or array-based antennas, our approach introduces a novel rapidly switched single-element technique for secure wireless applications that can be used independently from the rest of the wireless system, essentially operating as a ``black box'' for an additional layer of security.},

	abstract = {In this work we demonstrate an efficient technique for the registration and compositing of multiple automotive synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images as a step towards distributed SAR imaging. Through the use of an efficient sub-pixel Fourier-based iterative correlation and refinement technique, sub-sections of the overall SAR images are aligned. Because only small sub-regions of the full SAR images are aligned at a time, this technique inherently compensates for accelerations experienced when sampling the synthetic aperture, by assuming a quasi-constant velocity over small sub-regions of the image. Because the image fusion is performed after image formation, this technique lends itself well to a distributed architecture where the image formation is performed on-vehicle and transferred to other vehicles or a centralized cloud processor where images from other vehicles can be aggregated. Finally, because the registration of sub-regions of the SAR images are performed, the registration alignment vector can be used as a odometry provider to improve vehicle odometry estimates; if a metrology grade SAR map is used as reference, a globally reference position estimate could be performed.},

Achieving good performance in distributed antenna systems requires stringent synchronization at the wavelength and information level to ensure that the transmitted signals arrive coherently at the target, or that scattered and received signals can be appropriately processed via distributed algorithms. In this paper we address the challenge of high precision time synchronization to align the operations of elements in a distributed antenna array and to overcome time-varying bias between platforms due to oscillator drift. We use a spectrally sparse two-tone waveform, which obtains approximately optimal time estimation accuracy, in a two-way time transfer process. We also describe a technique for determining the true time delay using the ambiguous two-tone matched filter output, and we compare the time synchronization precision of the two-tone waveform with the more common linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveform. We experimentally demonstrate wireless time synchronization using a single pulse 40MHz two-tone waveform over a 90cm 5.8GHz wireless link in a laboratory setting, obtaining a timing precision of 2.26ps.},

The response of an interferometric radar to multiple targets can be complicated by the nonlinear processing, which generates intermodulation responses in addition to the desired fundamental frequency responses. An accurate signal model is critical for predicting and mitigating these intermodulation products and allows for model-based parameter estimation methods to be used to estimate target angular velocity. We derive a general response to an arbitrary number of independent targets and validate both the exact model and a simpler approximate model via simulation and experimental measurement with a 38-GHz continuous-wave interferometric radar. The experiment contains two targets traveling perpendicular to the radar's line-of-sight on linear stages at speeds of 0.36 and 0.5 m/s. We use an error metric to describe the similarity between the measured or simulated time-frequency response and the time-frequency response of a signal generated using the frequency estimates of either the exact or approximate models and show that in regimes where the small-angle approximation holds, both models provide an accurate representation of the measured or simulated interferometric response, demonstrating the feasibility of these models.},

We define an average radiation pattern that characterizes the space-time modulation of the array pattern and calculate a spatial information filter based on the additional modulation imparted on transmitted data. The concept is demonstrated experimentally using a two-element 1.5 GHz transmit array with relative motion between the elements. The array consists of two nodes, each with one dipole antennas transmitting BPSK data, and each with two log-periodic antennas used to estimate the relative separation of the nodes and correct the beamsteering phase of the transmitters. The node separation is varied dynamically over a range of $0.98\lambda$ -- $4.7\lambda$.

    switch matrix is presented. Measured results and reconstructed images are presented for both a PEC and dielectric
    cylinder as well as a wood sample and compared to their optical images.},
