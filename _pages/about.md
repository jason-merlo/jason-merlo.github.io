I am a Ph.D. student in the Distributed Electromagnetic Theory and Application (DELTA) sub-group of the Electromagnetics Research Group ([EMRG](https://www.egr.msu.edu/emrg/)) at Michigan State University advised by [Prof. Jeffrey Nanzer](http://www.jeffreynanzer.org/).  My current research interests include distributed interferometric arrays, radar detection and tracking, and radar applied to robotics applications.

Previously, I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Michigan State University where I co-founded the Student Organized Autonomy Research group ([SOAR](https://canvas.msu.edu/soar)) with the aim of enabling undergraduate and graduate students to become involved in autonomy research.

In addition to studying electromagnetics, I enjoy working on electrical projects, film photography, running, and mountain biking.
