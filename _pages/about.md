Jason received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA in 2018, where he is currently a Ph.D. candidate in electrical engineering. From 2017-2021 he was project manager and electrical systems team lead of the Michigan State University AutoDrive Challenge team. His current research interests include software-defined radios, distributed radar and wireless system synchronization, interferometric arrays, synthetic aperture radar, joint radar-communications, and automotive radar applications. He currently maintains two Python/C++ software packages used in-house for software-defined radio, radar, and distributed array coordination simulation and real-time signal processing.

Jason was a Finalist in the Student Paper Competition at the IEEE International Microwave symposium in 2024 and won First Place in 2023. He was a Finalist and Honorable Mention in the Student Paper Competition at the IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation in 2024 and 2023. He was the recipient of a 2023 IEEE MTT-S Graduate Fellowship and a 2023 URSI Young Scientist Award. He won Second Place in the Student Design Competition at the 2020 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and was a finalist in the Student Safety Technology Design Competition at the 2017 International Technical Conference on Enhanced Safety of Vehicles.
