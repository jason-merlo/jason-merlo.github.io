I am looking forward to presenting our work at the GNU Radio Conference in Tempe, AZ on September 7th. The talk ["High Accuracy Wireless Timing Synchronization Using Software Defined Radios"](https://events.gnuradio.org/event/21/contributions/413/) will cover our recent findings and techniques for high-accuracy time-frequency synchronization in software defined radios.
